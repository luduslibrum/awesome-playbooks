Incident Response Playbooks
---------------------------

The notion of incident response playbooks has recently gained attention. However, there are different definitions and perceptions.

*     What is a playbook to you?

    From an academic perspective, we use the following playbook definition:

    A playbook describes a specific incident response process or procedure based on a workflow with individual steps or actions.

    Playbooks are integral to SOAR platforms. Standardization efforts (e.g., OASIS CACAO) allow structured playbook representation and implementation. Playbooks structure best practices and executable instructions.

    *     Text-based (e.g., table, checklist - Markdown)
    *     Graphical (e.g., diagram - BPMN)
    *     Code-based (e.g., file, script - JSON, YAML, Python)
    *     Other: ___________________
