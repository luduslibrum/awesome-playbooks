# Cisco ASA - Create or remove access rules on an interface for IP Addresses

## Summary

This playbook allows blocking/unblocking of IPs in Cisco ASA, using **Access Control Entries** which will be created in an access control list.

When a new Sentinel incident is created, this playbook gets triggered and performs below actions
1. For the IPs we check if they are already directly blocked by an access control entry in the access control list
2. An adaptive card is sent to a Teams channel with information about the incident and giving the option to ignore an IP, or depdening on it's current status block it by adding an access control entry or unblock it by removing an access control entry
