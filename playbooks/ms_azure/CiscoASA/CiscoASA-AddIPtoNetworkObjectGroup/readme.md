# Cisco ASA - Add or remove IP Addresses from a Network Object Group

## Summary

This playbook allows blocking/allowing of IPs in Cisco ASA, using a **Network Object Group**. This allows making changes to a Network Object Group members, instead of making Access Control Entries. The Network Object Group itself should be part of an Access Control Entry.

When a new Sentinel incident is created,this playbook gets triggered and performs below actions
1. For the IPs we check if the are already a member of the Network Object Group
2. An adaptive card is sent to a Teams channel with information about the incident and giving the option to ignore an IP, or depdening on it's current status block it by adding it to the Network Object Group or unblock it by removing it from the Network Object Group

### Prerequisites
1. Cisco ASA custom connector needs to be deployed prior to the deployment of this playbook, in the same resource group and region. Relevant instructions can be found in the connector doc page.
2. In Cisco ASA there needs to be a Network Object Group. You can create a Network Object Group using Cisco ASDM, [Configure a Network Object Group](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa96/asdm76/firewall/asdm-76-firewall-config/access-objects.html#ariaid-title6), or using the CLI, [Configuring a Network Object Group](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa90/configuration/guide/asa_90_cli_config/acl_objects.html#86292). The Network Object Group can be blocked using an access rule, [Configure Access Rules](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa96/asdm76/firewall/asdm-76-firewall-config/access-rules.html#ID-2124-00000152)
