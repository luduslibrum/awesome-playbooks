# Enrich-SentinelIncident-GreyNoiseCommunity-IP
author: Nathan Swift

This playbook uses the GreyNoise Community API to automatically enrich incidents generated by Sentinel for IP addresses. Optionally to prevent rate limits you may want to obtain a valid GreyNoise API Key. To learn more about the service and request a trial key, see the [Setting up an Account](https://developer.greynoise.io/docs/setting-up-an-account). 

For details around the API used see the [Community API documentation](https://developer.greynoise.io/reference/community-api#get_v3-community-ip).
