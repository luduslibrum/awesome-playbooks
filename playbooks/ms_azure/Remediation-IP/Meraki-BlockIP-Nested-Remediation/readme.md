# Playbook steps explained
## When the playbook is triggered
  The playbook receives list of malicious IP addresses as the input.

## Compose image to add in the incident
This action will compose the Cisco Meraki image to add to the incident comments.

## Check if Organization exists
 *  If organization name exists in list of organizations associated with the account, then get list of networks associated with the organization. 
 *  If organization name does not exist, then terminate with the error that organization not found.

 ## Check if network exists
  *  If network name exists in list of networks associated with the account, then return network associated with the organization. 
 *  If network name does not exist, then terminate with the error that network not found.

## For each malicious IP received from the incident
 - Checks if the IP address is part of L3 firewall rule or L7 firewall rule of MX network.
  - If IP address is part of both L3 firewall rule and L7 firewall rule but not blocked by either of the rules, then response says IP address allowed by firewall.
  - If IP address is part of either L3 firewall rule or L7 firewall rule and blocked by the rule, then response says IP address is blocked.
  - If IP address is not part of either L3 firewall rule or L7 firewall rule, then that IP address is blocked by playbook. Response IP address blocked by playbook.
  - Responses from all the cases are combined.

## Response from playbook is sent to master playbook to generate incident comments.
