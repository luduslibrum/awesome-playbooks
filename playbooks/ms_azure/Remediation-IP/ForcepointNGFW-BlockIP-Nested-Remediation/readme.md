# Playbook steps explained
## When this playbook is triggered
  Captures potentially malicious or malware IP addresses incident information.

##Compose image to add in the incident
This action will compose the Forcepoint image to add to the incident comments.

##Check if security policy exists in SMC
*  If a security policy exists in the SMC firewall then check for the presence of IP addresses. 
*  If the security policy does not exist then terminate with the error that policy rule not found.

##For each malicious IP received from the incident

###Check if IP address is present in IP List Name
* If IP address is present in IP List Name then check if IP List is part of security policy rule.
* If IP address is not present in IP List Name then add the IP address to IP List Name. Response says IP address blocked by Playbook.

###Check if IP List is part of security policy in SMC
*  If a security policy exists in the SMC firewall for IP List Name then IP address is already blocked. Response says IP address already blocked.
*  If the security policy does not exist for IP List name then security policy is created for IP List Name.

##Response from playbook is sent to master playbook to generate incident comments.
