# Enrich-SentinelIncident-GreyNoise-IP
author: Nathan Swift

This playbook uses the GreyNoise APIs to automatically enrich incidents generated by Sentinel for IP addresses. You need a valid GreyNoise API Key in order to use the playbook. To learn more about the service and request a trial key, see the [Setting up an Account](https://developer.greynoise.io/docs/setting-up-an-account). 

For details around the APIs used see the [RIOT API documentation](https://developer.greynoise.io/reference/ip-lookup-1#riotip) and the [IP Context API documentation](https://developer.greynoise.io/reference/ip-lookup-1#noisecontextip-1).
