# AS_Alert_Spiderfoot_Scan

Author: Accelerynt

For any technical questions, please contact info@accelerynt.com 

This playbook is intended to be run from an Azure Sentinel alert. It will pull email addresses from the account entities in an alert and use them as targets in a Spiderfoot scan. By default, the scan is created using the HaveIBeenPwned module. The resulting report of that scan will be emailed to a recipient specified upon deployment.
