 ## Pre-requisites for deployment
1. Deploy the F5 BIG-IP Base Playbook before the deployment of this playbook under the same subscription and same resource group and under the same location/region. Capture the name of the playbook during deployment.
2. A Firewall policy rule should be created for blocking of IP.
3. An address list should be created for blocking IP.
4. The address list should be a part of Firewall policy rule.

## Authentication

* The REST APIs used by the playbook requires API Key access token which is generated by base playbook. The access token expires every 20 minutes. To be authenticated by the F5 Big IP resource, the access token (X-F5-Auth-Token) must be included with header in a REST API request.

# Post-Deployment Instructions 
## Configurations in Sentinel
- In Azure sentinel analytical rules should be configured to trigger an incident with IP addresses. 
- Configure the automation rules to trigger the playbook.

# Playbook steps explained
## When Azure Sentinel incident creation rule is triggered
  Captures potentially malicious or malware IP addresses incident information.

## Entities - Get IPs
  Get the list of IPs as entities from the Incident.

## Generate Access Token
 Call base playbook to generate access token.

 ## Check if IP Address List exists
 * If IP address list exists, then for each malicious IP check if that IP is part of IP address list.
 * If IP address list does not exist, terminate with error IP address list not found.

## For each malicious IP received from the incident
 - Checks if the IP address is part of IP address list.
  - If IP address is part of IP address list, then incident comment is created saying IP address is blocked.
  - If IP address is not part of IP address list, then add the IP address to IP address list for blocking in firewall. Incident comment created saying IP added to IP address list by playbook.
  - Incident Comment from both cases are combined.

- Update the incident with status close.
