This workflow seeks to inform the respective team if there is a pending incident. Firs of all, if incident count is 1 or over, an email is sent to a group mailbox to inform them of the pending incident/ticket. If count is equal to 0, the workflow isn't started.

If a response is given by the team in question, the incident will either be resolved successfully or not resolved at all. If the incident is resolved, the team will be notified of the resolution and this part of the workflow will be closed. If no response is made on the incident at all or there hasn't been a successful resolution, an SLA warning will be send to the mailbox to notify the team.
