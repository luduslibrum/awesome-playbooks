# Summary

This playbook leverages the Bit.ly API to retrieve the original URL that is being shortened by the bit.ly link. This action is triggered with the creation of a "bit.ly" or "bitly" url and results in the creation of the original URL in the platform as well as a description attribute pointing to it.

## Usage

Import the .pbx file into TC and set the Bit.ly API key when prompted. Make sure to also set the proper owners in the Trigger and the URL creation app.
