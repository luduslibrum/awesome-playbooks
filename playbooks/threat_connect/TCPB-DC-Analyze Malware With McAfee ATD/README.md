# Analyze Malware With McAfee ATD
## Summary
This Playbook will trigger when a malware document is tagged with "atd_submit". The malware will be submitted to McAfee Active Threat Defense for detonation. The Playbook will then ingest the detonation results. Depending on the severity that McAfee reports, the three file hash algorithms will be ingested with varying threat rating levels and associated to the root malware sample.
