# Store Attributes for the Unstructured Indicator Importer in Datastore

This playbook stores attributes from [https://gitlab.com/fhightower-tc/unstructured-indicator-importer/blob/master/example_datastore_attributes.json](https://gitlab.com/fhightower-tc/unstructured-indicator-importer/blob/master/example_datastore_attributes.json) in the datastore so that they can be accessed by the [unstructured indicator importer](https://gitlab.com/fhightower-tc/unstructured-indicator-importer).

**NOTE:** There are two versions of this playbook depending on which version of ThreatConnect you are running. If you are running a version after 5.6, use `[unstructured importer] Store Attributes in Datastore - post 5.6.pbx`; otherwise, use `[unstructured importer] Store Attributes in Datastore - pre 5.7.pbx`.

For more details, please see [https://gitlab.com/fhightower-tc/unstructured-indicator-importer#attributes-in-datastore-required](https://gitlab.com/fhightower-tc/unstructured-indicator-importer#attributes-in-datastore-required).
