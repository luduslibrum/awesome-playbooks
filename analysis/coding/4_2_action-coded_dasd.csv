In order for the workflow to run, you must select the specific detection rules you'd like to trigger this workflow upon detection in your environment. To do so: 1. Click the ""Edit in Builder"" button at the top-right of the Workflow Control Panel2. Open the ""ABA Process Start Event"" trigger step at the beginning of the Workflow, and click ""Previous"" at the bottom to be taken to the Detection Rule Configuration page3.

If so, the new indicator is tagged with ""multiple_owners"", denoting that it is a duplicate IOC. This is designed to be used in conjunction with a custom dashboard card to display the owner names and their number of duplicate indicators. The TQL syntax for the dashboard card is as follows:    typeName in (""Address"", ""EmailAddress"", ""File"", ""Host"", ""URL"") and tag in (""multiple_owners"")    For the card, choose to display as a chart and group by Owner Name.

The Playbook uses a User Action Trigger which presents a button on the Details page of Signature groups that, when pressed, will gather the contents of the Signature and SCP them over via SSH to the host running the Yara Manager. SSH is required because there is currently no API endpoint for uploading Yara rules.  ## Dependencies - Carbon Black Yara Manager - Valid SSH credentials  ## Input parameters The Playbook requires the following configuration parameters: - **SSH Hostname**: The host that the Carbon Black Yara Manager is running on,  - **SSH Username**: The username of the user with SSH permissions.  - **SSH Password**: The password of the user with SSH permissions.  - **SSH Port**: The port that SSH is running on (by default this is set to 22).  NOTE: The Playbook is configured to allow you to enter the SSH Hostname, Username, and Password information during the import process and will save them as Org Variables.   ## Output Variables N/A  For more information on Carbon Black's Yara Manager, please refer to [https://developer.carbonblack.com/guide/enterprise-response/cb-yara-manager-guide/](https://developer.carbonblack.com/guide/enterprise-response/cb-yara-manager-guide/);sends Rule To Carbon Black Yara Manager;;SSH sends Rule To Carbon Black Yara Manager;Carbon Black Yara Manager;send;rule;1
